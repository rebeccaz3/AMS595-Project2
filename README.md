# AMS595-Project2
**Overview** 

This project explores the Mandelbrot Set, a complex fractal structure, using MATLAB. The primary objectives are to generate the set, identify its boundary, fit a polynomial to the boundary, and calculate the length of the boundary. The implementation is organized into these 4 parts, with each part handled by specific MATLAB scripts and functions.

**File Descriptions** 

* Mandelbrot_Set_Script.m: Main script that orchestrates the exploration of the Mandelbrot Set, it will call the other functions. 

* fractal.m: Calculates the number of iterations for a complex point to determine if it belongs to the Mandelbrot Set.

* indicator_fn_at_x.m: Creates an indicator function for a vertical line at a given real value x (assigns values 1 for divergence, -1 for no divergence)

* bisection.m: Implements the bisection method to find boundary points of the fractal. It identifies where the indicator function switches sign, which are points that lie on the boundary. 

* poly_len.m: Computes the length of the fitted polynomial curve.


**How to Use** 

* Open all files in MATLAB.

* Run the Mandelbrot_Set_Script.m file. 

**Output**

The script will generate 3 visualizations of the Mandelbrot Set and its boundary points.

* The Mandelbrot Set, showcasing the distribution of points.

* The boundary points identified using the bisection method.

* The polynomial fit to the boundary points, illustrating how well the polynomial represents the fractalâ€™s edge.

It will also display the approximate length of the fractal boundary in the MATLAB command window.
